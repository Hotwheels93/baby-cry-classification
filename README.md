# baby-cry-classification
Baby cry classification based on tinyML on ESP32 microcontroller

### Overview
The idea of classifying baby cries is not new and has already been researched and implemented in numerous projects. This project aims to implement a model for the recognition of the different cry patterns, which recognizes the intention of the communication or the underlying need as accurately as possible and in real time. In order to develop a solution that is as compact and cost-effective as possible, the ESP32 was chosen as the target platform.

### Possible use cases
- Support for parents with hearing loss or deafness
- Improvement of communication between the baby and parents
- Avoiding misinterpretation of needs and their consequences, for example overfeeding
- Helping babysitters, relatives and friends to better understand the babys needs 

### Used Dataset 
The data sets for the training and validation of the model based from different sources. On the one hand, they are based on real data of already existing projects, on the other hand, artificial samples were generated with the help of [AudioLDM](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM).
